# Enable Security

OpenMetadata has support for Google SSO and Okta SSO as identity providers. Please see the next sections about how to configure them.

Enabling Security is only required for your production installation. If you are testing OpenMetadata it will be easier and faster to setup without security.   
Please refer to our ["Run OpenMetadata Guide"](https://docs.open-metadata.org/install/run-openmetadata).
