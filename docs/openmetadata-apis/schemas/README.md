# Schemas

## Schema Modeling

OpenMetadata takes the **schema-first** approach to model metadata as a Single Source of Truth with clear vocabulary for the system. First, the Entities, Types, and relationships between the entities in the system are identified and schemas are defined for them. Code is then generated from these schemas for implementation.
