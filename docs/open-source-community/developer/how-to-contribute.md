# How to Contribute

Welcome to [OpenMetadata](https://open-metadata.org). Our goal is to build an Open standard for Metadata. We genuinely believe this mission can only be achieved through building a great community.

We ❤️ all contributions, big and small!

## Github issues

Look for issues under [github/issues tab](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/issues) . If you have a feature request or found a bug please file an issue. This will help us track and will help community overall as well.
